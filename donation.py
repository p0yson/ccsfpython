Description: The American Red Cross wants you to write a program that will calculate the average pints of blood donated during a blood drive. The program should take in the number of pints donated during the drive, based on a seven hour drive period. The average pints donated during that period should be calculated and displayed. Additionally, the highest and the lowest number of pints donated should be determined and displayed.
